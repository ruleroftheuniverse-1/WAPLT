**CB5T‚ÄìFEP‚ÄìAI** model might be the closest published attempt to formalize something like polarity-based personology framework using predictive processing and free energy principles.

### üß† Core Premise

The paper attempts to unify **personality neuroscience (CB5T: Cybernetic Big Five Theory)** with the **Free Energy Principle (FEP)** and **Active Inference (AI)**. It frames **personality traits as meta-priors**‚Äîlong-term probabilistic constraints that guide lower-level perceptual, cognitive, and action processes to reduce uncertainty and maintain organismal viability.

### üß© Conceptual Parallels

| **CB5T‚ÄìFEP‚ÄìAI Term**             | **Polarity Model Equivalent**                                    |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Traits as Meta-Priors            | Polar strategies as high-level thermodynamic gradients or attractors       |
| Set-point shifts in trait priors | Developmental trajectory across the 3√ó2 polarity axes                      |
| Free energy minimization         | Homeodynamic regulation across pleasure-pain, self-other, etc.             |
| Precision-weighting of signals   | Active/passive polarity engagement; selective attention and model updating |
| Exploration vs. exploitation     | Modification vs. accommodation strategies                                  |
| Autonomic/affective regulation   | Embodied basis of personality expression                                   |

The idea that **traits function as enduring precision-weighted priors** that modulate belief updating resonates deeply with your vision of **personality as strategy optimization over uncertain environments**.

### üß¨ Structural and Dynamical Insight

The authors also stress:

* Personality traits influence **affective tone**, **goal generation**, and **resource allocation**.
* They shape how the system **samples the world**, much like how your model treats pleasure-seeking and pain-avoidance as environmental interaction modes.

There's a great line in here: *‚ÄúPersonality reflects a relatively stable prior over deep (hierarchical) generative models.‚Äù* That‚Äôs basically your personological field theory expressed in FEP-speak.

### üîÅ What's Missing (That You Provide)

* **Developmental time:** They don‚Äôt model personality formation as a dynamic unfolding through environmental dialectics, which your polarity-stage mapping does.
* **Conflict and internal contradiction:** You emphasize **ambivalent and misaligned strategies** (e.g., RCC/DRN fusion), while this model leans ideal-typical.
* **Symbolic and psychosocial systems:** Their model remains bio-cognitive; yours integrates **structural and sociological adaptation layers** (like institutions, roles, scripts).
* **Ethical valence:** Your work frames strategies as more than adaptiveness‚Äîthey have moral/teleological weight. Their model is functionally agnostic.
