## Notes on Method
---
   * Every personality pattern, variant, or observation should ultimately “hang” on the eight axes: Pain, Pleasure, Accomodation, Modification, Self, Other, Feeling, Thinking
   * All variant language, clinical cases, trait names, and anecdotes should be mappable onto one or more of these axes.

2. **Trait Domains as “Lighting Up” the Structure**

   * When old notes describe *how* a trait manifests (e.g., “abrasive conduct,” “impoverished cognition”), we’ll cross-index it as one of the trait domains for the spectrum(s) in question.
   * This gives a “heatmap” feel for each spectrum—where in the psyche/system does the pattern express most intensely?

3. **Decompensation, Trauma, and Sliders**

   * Any clinical vignettes, stories, or observations about breakdown, transition, or severity should be tagged as “slider” positions—i.e., how far along the continuum from healthy → style → type → disorder → decompensation.
   * When trauma is mentioned (explicitly or implicitly), note how it distorts the basic polarity setup (e.g., from integrated to split, from flexible to rigid).

4. **Structural vs. Functional Pathology**

   * For every spectrum, when old notes discuss *rigidity, fragmentation, or system defects* (structural), versus *conflicts, reversals, or swings* (functional), we’ll flag and map accordingly.
   * This lets us differentiate “broken” architectures from “misfiring” or conflicted ones, a distinction that’s especially useful in theorizing both causes and possible interventions.

5. **Variants as Dynamic Pathways**

   * All personality “subtypes,” anecdotal cases, or quotes about behavioral extremes can be classified along the path from mild/adaptive variant → pathological → clinical.
   * For each, we’ll try to specify where the observed case lies on the spectrum, and (if possible) what triggered any shifts.

6. **Meta-Thematic Notes**

   * Any *bigger-picture* hypotheses (about culture, group dynamics, or the nature of “evil”) should be earmarked for later placement in Chapters 3–4, but still coded by which core polarities or structural/functional features they implicate.

### **How to Process Incoming Notes and Summaries**

**For each summary or fragment you send in this thread:**

* I’ll tag it to one or more spectra and polarity axes
* Extract and slot trait domains into the relevant grid(s)
* Annotate severity/variant level and any trauma/biophysical “slider” movements
* Flag whether the observation is best understood as structural or functional
* Note any broader implications for group/cultural theory or “evil” for later synthesis
