* Every personality pattern, variant, or observation must map to eight axes: 
	Pleasure 
	Pain 
	Accomodation 
	Modification 
	Self 
	Other 
	Feeling 
	Thinking

* Any clinical vignettes, stories, or observations about breakdown, transition, or severity should be tagged as “slider” positions—i.e., how far along the continuum from healthy → style → type → disorder → decompensation.
* When trauma is mentioned (explicitly or implicitly), note how it distorts the basic polarity setup (e.g., from integrated to split, from flexible to rigid).

* For every spectrum, when old notes discuss *rigidity, fragmentation, or system defects* (structural), versus *conflicts, reversals, or swings* (functional), we’ll flag and map accordingly.
* This lets us differentiate “broken” architectures from “misfiring” or conflicted ones, a distinction that’s especially useful in theorizing both causes and possible interventions.

* All personality “subtypes,” anecdotal cases, or quotes about behavioral extremes can be classified along the path from mild/adaptive variant → pathological → clinical.
* For each, we’ll try to specify where the observed case lies on the spectrum, and (if possible) what triggered any shifts.
* Annotate severity/variant level and any trauma/biophysical “slider” movements
* Flag whether the observation is best understood as structural or functional
* Note any broader implications for group/cultural theory or “evil” for later synthesis
