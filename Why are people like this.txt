Why are people like this?
	The current mainstream debate centers on the gene/environment distinction, these two categories explaining all human behaviors, each to varying degrees. While this basic categorization of the causes of our behavior is fruitful, it's not the only useful division. Some alternatives:
		Determined/random
			I'm not sure whether randomness is a factor in human behavior, but if it is, then this distinction precedes many others, including gene/environment. 
				I suspect what some are thinking of as random is in fact simply determined by causes ignored by one's model. 
					E.g. birth order of twins is determined by physical factors, but people deem them irrelevant, thus leaving birth order causeless, though following predictable patterns in the long term
			Has this been explored? I don't believe in randomness, so I'm a bit lost here.
			Orderly/chaotic are subcategories of determined. Does random have analogous subcategories?			
		Levels of organization (molceular...societal)
			Quanta, Atom, Molecule, Cell, Tissue, Organ, Organ system, Organism, Clan, Tribe, Society, Species, Genus, Family, Class, Order, Phylum, Kingdom, Domain, Biosphere
			Position, Movement, Behavior, Action, Action system, Personality, Family, Subculture, Culture, Nature, ?--(natures?)
		Syn/diachronic
		Mental/physical
		Un/conscious
		Funky combination of the above?
			Perhaps it's most intuitive to find a spectrum or collection of more than two categories to start with, though anything can be split into a dichotomy.
