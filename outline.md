Why Are People Like This?
Towards a Dynamical Field Theory of Personology

Chapter 0: Intro

Context: Life
Problem: People
Thesis: Psychoengineering

Chapter 1: Personology

Why map out personality?
1.1 – The practical and theoretical need to understand stable behavioral–cognitive–affective systems
1.2 – Applications: prediction, intervention, self-knowledge

What is Personology?

1.3 – Definitions: person vs. human, personality as coordinated action-system strategy
1.4 – Core constructs: evolutionary polarity model (Pain–Pleasure, Active–Passive, Self–Other)

How do we study personality?

1.5 – Trait domains (behavior, phenomenology, intrapsychic, biophysical)
1.6 – Structural vs. functional levels of organization
1.7 – Assessment methods: clinical, psychometric, biological

When does personality emerge and change?
1.8 – Developmental timeline (0–9 years, consolidation of strategy clouds)
1.9 – Plasticity and stability across the lifespan
1.10 – Life events and gradual drift vs. sudden shifts


Chapter 2: Dissociation

Why focus on dissociation?

2.1 – The breakdown of unified personology: from infant multiple-selves to adult fragmentation
2.2 – Clinical importance: trauma, DID, PTSD, comorbidities

What is dissociation?

2.3 – Conceptual definitions: structural vs. functional dissociation
2.4 – The dissociative continuum: normative to pathological
2.5 – Key syndromes: dissociative amnesia, depersonalization, derealization, DID

How does dissociation work?

2.6 – Mechanisms: defense, compartmentalization, state-dependent memory
2.7 – Neurobiology: HPA axis, limbic modulation, connectivity disruptions
2.8 – Assessment and diagnosis: interviews, scales, task-based markers

When does dissociation arise and resolve?

2.9 – Developmental windows: early trauma, attachment disruptions
2.10 – Course: acute vs. chronic, triggers and cues
2.11 – Integration and treatment windows

Chapter 3: Contextual Personology

Why embed personality in context?

3.1 – Personality only makes sense within social, cultural, and ecological systems
3.2 – Goals: prediction of behavior, design of healthier environments

What is “context”?

3.3 – Levels: dyadic, group, institutional, cultural, historical
3.4 – Constructs: norms, roles, power structures, collective meanings

How do personalities and contexts interact?

3.5 – Models: gene-environment interplay, niche-construction, social feedback loops
3.6 – Methods: ethnography, social network analysis, agent-based modeling

When does context shape or reshape personality?

3.7 – Sensitive periods: adolescence, major life transitions
3.8 – Crisis points: economic collapse, war, mass trauma
3.9 – Long-term cultural evolution vs. rapid subcultural shifts

Chapter 4: Evil & Maladaptive Extremes

Why study “evil”?
4.1 – Moral-social imperative: preventing harm, supporting victims
4.2 – Bridging “normal” pathology (Axis II) with mass violence and atrocity

What is “evil” in personality terms?

4.3 – Definitions: S&M-reversal (sadism/masochism), malignant narcissism, paraphenias
4.4 – Profiles: ADS sadistic, AAM masochistic, MPP malignant, UBC self-destructive, ESS implosive

How does evil emerge and operate?

4.5 – Intrapsychic mechanisms: projection, splitting, escalation dynamics
4.6 – Group-level: Ponerology, radicalization, authoritarianism
4.7 – Biological substrates: aggression circuits, fear conditioning, reward dysregulation

When are individuals most at risk for evil acts?

4.8 – Developmental antecedents: early cruelty, neglect, trauma
4.9 – Contextual catalysts: war, ideology, social contagion
4.10 – Windows for intervention: pre-incident warning signs, de-radicalization
